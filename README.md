# EEG-Dataset-Classification-for-Different-Gestures-for-People-Suffering-from-Spinal-Cord-Injuries

Electroencephalography(EEG) signals are generated by people suffering from spinal cord injuries and can be used to classify various gestures made by a subject. Although data generated by a subject is a low-frequency signal; however, with advances of technologies to detect low signal frequencies, it is now possible to record those signals which can be further analyzed. For further analysis of EEG signals which is spatial-temporal data, we have used one of the methods of Deep Learning which is named Spiking Neural Network (SNN). We have also used NeuCube software for cues classification and the visualization of a network learning.
